# Roman-Numerals
Roman Numerals Addition without conversion to numeric values

#### Algorithm for Addition<br />
  * Substitute for any subtractives in both values; that is; "uncompact" the Roman values.<br />
  * Put the two values togetherâ€”catenate them.<br />
  * Sort the symbols in order from left-to-right with the "largest" symbols on the left.<br />
  * Starting with the right end, combine groups of the same symbols that can make a "larger" one and substitute the single larger one.<br />
  * Compact the result by substituting subtractives where possible.<br />
